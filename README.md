# Guess the Number Game
This is a simple Python exercise designed to help you grasp the fundamentals of import statements, comparison operators, and using if and break statements effectively. When you run this program, you'll be greeted and asked to input your name. After that, the game will begin, where you'll be prompted to guess a number. Depending on your input, the program will inform you if your guess is too high or too low, and it will continue until you either guess the correct number or exhaust all ten attempts.
